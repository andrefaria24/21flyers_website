<h1>Mattituck Offers Preheating Advice For Winter Flying </h1>

<P>Whenever the air temperature drops to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, or lower, 
piston aircraft engines should be preheated before starting. Starts in the 
20 to 35 degree range require some precautions to avoid premature wear or 
immediate engine damage. These guidelines were provided by Jay Wickham, 
President of Mattituck Air Base, the world's largest independent engine 
overhaul facility. 

<P>"Below 20 degrees, oil may begin to thicken," said Wickham. "This is 
especially true of the SAE mineral type oils that are used in the first 50 
hours after overhaul. They are single weight oils and are the most likely 
to become viscous. Even the multi-weight ashless dispersent oils begin to 
thicken when the mercury dips into the teens. Most engines are equipped 
with congealing oil coolers, and even if the engine has a non-congealing 
cooler, a termo by-pass valve can force congealed oil directly into the 
engine. We've seen engines come in here that had catastrophic failures due 
to improper starts in cold weather." 

<P>Wickham reported that at times the engine may appear to be running 
normally and warming up nicely, but it can still sustain serious damage 
from lack of lubrication due to restrictive oil flow. Initial oil pressure 
and temperature readings can be erroneous. 

<P>"It's essential to read and adhere to the engine manufacturer's 
recommendations regarding cold weather operations," said Wickham. 
"Pre-heating normally takes 20 to 30 

<P>minutes to assure that all lines and all parts of the engine are 
uniformly warmed. Air should be forced up through the bottom of the cowl 
to reach the oil filter, sump area and intake manifold. Additional heat 
should be directed over the top of the engine to reach the cylinders and 
cooler." 

<P>Once an engine is pre-heated, it can be started but should be run for 5 
to 10 minutes at idle settings, not at 1000 to 1200 rpm. It is essential 
to check oil pressure, which can take up to 45 seconds to rise into the 
green. If a full minute goes by without reaching a proper oil pressure 
setting the engine should be shut down and inspected. It probably needs 
more pre-heating. 

<P>"An important reason for running at low idle is that oil may not have 
reached all areas requiring lubrication.. even though there may be an oil 
pressure indication," said Wickham. "A number of parts in the engine are 
bathed in 'slung' or splashed oil. But a fluid with the consistency of 
honey doesn't splash very well." Another problem with high rpm warm ups is 
that some parts expand faster than others. When run at high rpms, piston 
skirts can warm up and expand faster than cylinder walls, leading to 
contact with the walls and possible seizure. 

<P>Generally, when running with single weight oils, it's appropriate to 
use 30 weight in winter, 40 in spring/fall and 50 in the summer months. 

<P>With adequate pre-heating and taking time to let the engine warm up at 
slow idle there should be no cause for premature wear and/or damage. 
"Freezing temperatures require a little planning and patience," said 
Wickham. "Your engine feels the cold, too."
