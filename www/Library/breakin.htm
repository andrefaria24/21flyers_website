<h1>Hard Facts About Engine Break-In </h1>

<P>Most people seem to operate on the 
philosophy that they can best get their money’s worth from any mechanical 
device by treating it with great care. This is probably true, but in many 
cases it is necessary to interpret what great care really means. This is 
particularly applicable when considering the break-in of a modern, 
reciprocating aircraft engine. Aircraft owners frequently ask about the 
proper procedures for run-in of a new or remanufactured engine so they can 
carefully complete the required steps. Many of these recommended break-in 
procedures also apply to engines which have been overhauled or had a 
cylinder replaced.</P>

<P>The first careful consideration 
for engine run-in is the oil to be used. The latest revision of Textron 
Lycoming Service Instruction 1014 should be consulted for this 
information. The basic rule which applies to most normally aspirated 
Lycoming piston engines is simple; use straight mineral oil of the proper 
viscosity for the first fifty hours or until oil consumption stabilizes. 
Then switch to ashless dispersant (AD) oil.</P>

<P>The exceptions to the basic rule 
above are the O-320-H and the O/LO-360-E series. These engines may be 
operated using either straight mineral oil or ashless dispersant oil, 
however, if the engine is delivered with ashless dispersant oil installed, 
it must remain on ashless dispersant oil. The Textron Lycoming oil 
additive P/N LW-16702 must be added to the O-320-H and O/LO-360-E engines 
at airframe installation, and every 50 hours thereafter or at every oil 
change. An FAA-approved lubricating oil that contains, in the proper 
amount, an oil additive equivalent to LW-16702 will meet the requirements 
for the additive as stated in Lycoming Service Instruction No. 
1014M.</P>

<P>All Lycoming turbocharged engines 
must be broken in with ashless dispersant oil only.</P>

<P>When taking delivery of a new 
aircraft, there is another point which must be emphasized. Some aircraft 
manufacturers add approved preservative lubricating oil to protect new 
engines from rust and corrosion at the time the aircraft leaves the 
factory. This preservative oil must be removed by the end of the first 25 
hours of operation.</P>

<P>Each new or remanufactured engine 
is given a production test run at the factory before the engine is 
delivered to an aircraft manufacturer or other customer. After 
installation in the aircraft, the engine is run again during the test 
flights. These test runs will insure that the engine is operating normally 
and will provide an opportunity to locate small oil leaks or other minor 
discrepancies. In addition, these test runs do the initial seating of the 
piston rings. The rest of the break-in is the responsibility of the pilot 
who flies the aircraft during the next 50 hours.</P>

<P>A new, remanufactured, or 
overhauled engine should receive the same start, warm-up, and preflight 
checks as any other engine. There are some aircraft owners and pilots who 
would prefer to use low power settings for cruise during the break-in 
period. This is not recommended. A good break-in requires that the piston 
rings expand sufficiently to seat with the cylinder walls during the 
engine break-in period. This seating of the ring with the cylinder wall 
will only occur when pressures inside the cylinder are great enough to 
cause expansion of the piston rings. Pressures in the cylinder only become 
great enough for a good break-in when power settings above 65% are 
used.</P>

<P>Full power for takeoff and climb 
during the break-in period is not harmful; it is beneficial, although 
engine temperatures should be monitored closely to insure that overheating 
does not occur. Cruise power settings above 65%, and preferably in the 70% 
to 75% of rated power range should be used to achieve a good engine 
break-in.</P>

<P>It should be remembered that if 
the new or remanufactured engine is normally aspirated (nonturbocharged), 
it will be necessary to cruise at the lower altitudes to obtain the 
required cruise power levels. Density altitudes in excess of 8000 feet 
(5000 feet is recommended) will not allow the engine to develop sufficient 
cruise power for a good break-in.</P>

<P>For those who still think that 
running the engine hard during break-in falls into the category of cruel 
and unusual punishment, there is one more argument for high power settings 
during engine break-in. The use of low power settings does not expand the 
piston rings enough, and a film of oil is left on the cylinder walls. The 
high temperatures in the combustion chamber will oxidize this oil film so 
that it creates a condition commonly known as glazing of the cylinder 
walls. When this happens, the ring break-in process stops, and excessive 
oil consumption frequently occurs. The bad news is that extensive glazing 
can only be corrected by removing the cylinders and rehoning the walls. 
This is expensive, and it is an expense that can be avoided by proper 
break in procedures.</P>

<P>To summarize, there are just a few 
items to remember about engine break-in: (1) If a preservative oil has 
been added by the aircraft manufacturer, drain it not later than the first 
25 hours of operation; (2) Follow the engine manufacturers recommendation 
regarding the oil to be used for break-in and the period between changes; 
(3) Run the engine at high cruise power levels for best piston 
ring/cylinder wall mating; (4) Continue break in operation for 50 hours or 
until oil consumption stabilizes. These simple procedures should eliminate 
the possibility of cylinder wall glazing and should prepare the engine for 
a long and satisfactory service 
life.</P>
